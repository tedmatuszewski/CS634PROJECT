                        I now resign myself to the telling of this story with as much honor and integrity as humanly possible. For I am human, and therefore, devoid of perfection at this current point in time.
                        Both my physical and spiritual connectedness to the future of the following encounters began on my 27th year, following the acute awareness  of the patterns of leaves on a birch tree atop the mountain overlooking Asheville, North Carolina. It had made such an impression on me, as to have called me a frequent, and rather obnoxious, visitor; Staring ubiquitously at it's greeny, leafy new knees. It's herringbone edges, it's limey complexion had, to me, seemed to have gone unnoticed by the proprietors of the cabin nearby (in which I was currently staying). It's golden, sunstroke walls in it's interior were littered with the faces of strangers caught in a frame. Sadness hoped to be seen in their eyes (though I do believe I am one of the few who, upon close examination did witness this distrust of the future). In seeming obligation to the name of the mountain in which this cabin now stood, there too was strewn about it's interior facade depictions of black bears. Small ones, big ones, photographs, drawings, ashtrays now swept clean. Signs, warning signs, to not ever neglect the proper disposal of any garbage bags. Rather, to make damn sure to place all garbage into the proper locked recepticals at the top of the hill, or be so bold as to meet kindness abundantly and remove all bags and boxes from the hill entirely. Presumably dumping said garbage behind a grocery store, or a nearby landfill. All this for the bears. All of this for the people. But nothing for the tree. THIS tree. It's roots far beneath the edge of the porch, it's crest higher up that the tip top of the roof's cresting "V" that jutted out of the side of Black Bear Mountain. And yet, no ashtrays to commemorate, no longing gaze of wondrous, awe-inspiring shame at humanities own shortcomings; Our own inability to take from the Earth, from it's soil with the very souls of our feet. But there he stood. With His greeny leafy knees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having descended the mountain, I returned home. Resigned to the notion that there had been nothing plagiaristic notions in the whispering voice, my full attention now lie in her loins. For, truthfully, it was the single most moment of clarity I had ever experienced and had found itself to be the only research deemed relevant to my life at it's inception. The hours upon the mountain had yielded very little fruit, and yet there was a whisper I felt called to the wilds of discovery, the passionate gouging of one's own soul to reveal it to the outside world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before too much time had passed, I found it ultimately necessary to separate myself from The Society of Formiddable Fear and branched out on my own. For, in the face of absolute peril, I do believe we find ourselves: In the silent respite of stillness, there our hearts will follow.</p>
                    <p>Poorly masking my insecurities, I stumbled into the mire of formal research. Licking my wounds all the while I peddled forward through the pages, through hoards of language and dynasties and muck. Falling effervescently into the future of our nations past and it's continuous follicular actions repeated over countless decades. Until, one day I stumbled upon what can only be described as the most decrepit old little thing you'd ever seen. Leatherbound, red, and blue, and stinking of thrust, hung in the air between it's pages. This old dinosaur smelt of manuscript and poised itself like a cave. Rather nimbly I dared pick it up (with all of my fingers and none of my palm) and read the inscription of it's binding: "The Bird Catcher Tree".</p>
                    <p>As I summoned the pages to turn, this deified manuscript spoke at length on the Pisonia brunoniana. it's unique glory and ultimate sacrificial tendency to quell and destroy life at it's own discrepancy and will of survival.</p>
