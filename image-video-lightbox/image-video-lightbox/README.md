# JS Lightbox

## Usage

JS Lightbox is a JavaScript lightbox for images and videos that requires only jQuery.

JS Lightbox will provide an enlarged version of the image/video clicked that fills 95% of the screen height or width (At max, scaling to not be too large for device.) with an transparent black background.

If the image or video is enlarged and clicked again the lightbox will close.

Videos are currently set to autoplay with `autoplay webkit-playsinline loop` but can be adjusted in lightbox.js `line 29`.

## Installation

Give any image for use a class of `.lightbox-img` and any video `.lightbox-vid`.

Make sure to include both the CSS and JS on your page and the lightbox will automatically function.
